		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_PhotonSail_Title = BP-541L "Starshot" Photon-Sail
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_PhotonSail_Description = When the engineers at Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics first saw the blue-print for this part, they outright refused to believe this wasn't just a joke. The scientists then held a long lecture explaining how eventhough there is no wind in space, the sail can be pushed by photons from beamed power. This part doesn't have to carry any propellant, and thus is capable of achieving significant fractions of the speed of light. Its major drawback is its very low thrust, even for a lot of power beamed.

		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_ThermalEngine_Title = BP-TE "Unradioactive" Thermal Engine
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_ThermalEngine_Desc = Sort of like a nuclear engine, it heats propellant thermally rather than through a chemical reaction. The heat in this case however, comes from beamed energy. No more having to carry around a heavy nuclear reactor! This engine gets much higher thrust-to-weight ratio than it's nuclear-powered cousins. On the other hand, it does nothing on its own, it needs beamed power. Remember that!
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_ThermalEngine_tags = thermal, heat, receiver, engine, propul, beamed, power
		
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_AblativeEngine_title = BP-AE "Sublimation" Ablative Engine
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_AblativeEngine_desc = Just a giant, heavy dome of metal with electrical things attached to the sides. Nothing unusual about it. Of course its not an 8000K weapon, we definitely wouldn't use it for that, would we? Caution: the exhaust can boil anything when running, keep away from kerbals. Oh, and this needs beamed energy to do anything.
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_AblativeEngine_tags = ablat, engine, propul, beamed, power, plasma, pulse
		
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_TransmitterDish_title = BP-T1 "Microwaving" Power Transmitter
		#LOC_BeamedPower_Parts_TransmitterDish_desc = A large parabolic dish - 5m across, which can beam power generated by your craft to another craft. The beam produced is more focused due to the large diameter, and the power is beamed in a longer wavelength which allows for better efficiency. It also doubles as a long range antenna, which can be used to message Jebediah who was 'accidentally' sent into deep space with no snacks. However, it is inconveniently huge, good luck fitting this into a fairing!
